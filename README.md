This project is a REST-based multi-currency converter that supports conversion between USD, INR, EUR, GBP, SGD, and JPY. The backend is implemented using PHP and exposes RESTful APIs to fetch exchange rates and perform currency conversion by reading values dynamically from a MySQL database. A separate frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript consumes these APIs to provide a simple and user-friendly interface. The project demonstrates core concepts of REST APIs, client–server architecture, and database-driven application design without using any hardcoded exchange rates.Code review added using CodeRabbit
